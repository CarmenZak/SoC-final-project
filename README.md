## Problem Statement

In a world where face-to-face interactions have been replaced by screen-to-screen communication, staying connected with friends, family, and colleagues has become more challenging. Traditional quiz games often lack a truly interactive, real-time multiplayer experience, making learning and competition feel isolated rather than engaging.

Additionally, students and learners struggle with motivation, often settling for mediocrity rather than pushing themselves to excel. There is a need for a fun yet educational platform that not only encourages friendly competition but also reinforces knowledge in a way that feels engaging and rewarding.

---

## Solution

our solution is a fun, lightweight trivia-based party game that allows players to compete in real time across a variety of knowledge categories, including custom educational topics. Whether you’re a student cramming for an exam, a bootcamp alumnus reinforcing technical skills, or a group of friends looking for a challenge, our app provides an exciting way to test knowledge, track scores, and motivate continuous learning through a shared leaderboard.

With single-player and multiplayer modes, users can either challenge themselves individually or compete with friends, making learning engaging, competitive, and social. By combining education with entertainment, this app brings people together—proving once and for all who has what it takes to win while fostering a culture of continuous learning.
